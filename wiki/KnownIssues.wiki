#summary The list of known issues with Mace
#labels Featured

Nothing is perfect and Mace is no exception! Here's a list of bugs that I'm aware of:

 * The terrain suddenly changes between the city and the natural terrain
  * This is because the terrain is being generated by two separate applications. I currently have no plans to fix this, but I might write a tool to fix it in the future.

 * Flags will catch fire if the outside lights are made of fire.
  * This will be fixed in the next version.

 * The code may not work on OSX.
  * If you get it working, please let me know.

 * Portal blocks are not rotated correctly 50% of the time.
  * Unfortunately nothing can be done about this.
