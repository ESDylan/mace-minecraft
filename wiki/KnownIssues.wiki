#summary The list of known issues with Mace
#labels Featured

Nothing is perfect and Mace is no exception! Here's a list of bugs that I'm aware of:

 * The terrain and regions suddenly change between the city and the natural terrain
  * This is because the terrain is being generated by two separate applications. I'm hoping that future versions of Minecraft will allow for this problem to be fixed or lessened.

 * The spawn location isn't in the direction of the city.
  * I'm currently trying to figure out how to fix this. Look for a fix soon!

 * Chests are orientated the wrong way.
  * This will be fixed in Mace 1.8

 * Paintings are black.
  * This can be fixed by upgrading to Minecraft 1.0.0

 * Millenaire sometimes overwrites the Mace cities with it's own cities.
  * Unfortunately this is out of my control.

 * The code may not work on OSX.
  * Please let me know about your experiences with running the code on OSX, whether they are good or bad.

 * Portal blocks are not rotated correctly 50% of the time.
  * Minecraft doesn't allow them to be rotated when they aren't part of a portal. So unfortunately nothing can be done about this.
