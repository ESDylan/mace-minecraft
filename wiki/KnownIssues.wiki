#summary The list of known issues with Mace
#labels Featured

Nothing is perfect and Mace is no exception! Here's a list of bugs that I'm aware of:

 * Paintings are black.
  * This is a bug in Minecraft, but it has been fixed now. Just upgrade your version of Minecraft and everything will work correctly.

 * The terrain suddenly changes between the city and the natural terrain
  * This is because the terrain is being generated by two separate applications. I might write a tool to fix this in the future.

 * Millenaire sometimes overwrites the Mace cities with it's own cities.
  * Unfortunately this is out of my control.

 * The code may not work on OSX.
  * Please let me know about your experiences with running the code on OSX, whether they are good or bad.

 * Portal blocks are not rotated correctly 50% of the time.
  * Minecraft doesn't allow them to be rotated when they aren't part of a portal. So unfortunately nothing can be done about this.
