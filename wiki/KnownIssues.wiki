Nothing is perfect and Mace is no exception! Here's a list of bugs that I'm aware of:

 * Flags will catch fire if the outside lights are made of fire.
  * This will be fixed in the next version.

 * The code may not work on OSX.
  * If you get it working, please let me know.

 * Portal blocks are not rotated correctly 50% of the time.
  * Unfortunately nothing can be done about this.
