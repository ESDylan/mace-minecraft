This refers to the buildings within the city.

= Planned features for buildings =

Mace will include a !MineCraft world, which contains lots of different buildings. These buildings will then be extracted from the world and placed within the generated city, with various elements modified to create more variety.

Some buildings are done already. Here are some more buildings that I would like to add:

  * More types of houses
  * Warehouse
  * Bakery
  * King's vegetables
  * Park
  * Fountain
  * Brothel
  * City square
  * City hall
  * Tavern

Some buildings need random elements, which are:

  * Gravestone sign maker
  * Statue placard maker

= Other planned features =

  * Streets
  * Splitting the city into districts
  * Street lanterns
