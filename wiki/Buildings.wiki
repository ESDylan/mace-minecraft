Some buildings are done already. Here are some more buildings that I would like to add:

  * Churches
  * City hall
  * Ruined buildings
  * Others...

  * Rotation (ideally to the nearest path)

= Other planned features =

  * Would be nice to have underground areas in some buildings (wine cellars, basements, etc)
  * Buildings with multiple stories
  * Street names
  * Splitting the city into districts (probably based on rich/poor)
  * Street lanterns
