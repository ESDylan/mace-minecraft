#summary Explanation and planned features

= Introduction =

This refers to the buildings within the city.

= Planned features for buildings =

Some buildings are done already. Here are some more buildings that I would like to add:

  * More types of houses
  * Park
  * Brothel
  * City hall
  * Tavern
  * Others...

Some buildings need random elements, which are:

  * Gravestone sign maker
  * Statue placard maker
  * House name/number
  * Rotation to the nearest paths
  * Importing chests and other entities

= Other planned features =

  * The amount of buildings need to be determine by random weighted chance. For example, there should be more houses and trees, but less graveyards and statues.
  * Would be nice to have underground areas in some buildings (wine cellars, basements, etc)
  * Streets (ideally with names)
  * Splitting the city into districts (probably based on rich/poor)
  * Street lanterns
