#summary Explanation and planned features

= Introduction =

This refers to the buildings within the city.

= Planned features =

I'm planning to make lots of buildings manually in !MineCraft, then export them to files. The city generator will then select random files to make the city.

The list of buildings is almost endless, but I'll be focussing on buildings that have a purpose, such as:

  * House (sleeping)
  * Warehouse (storage)
  * Blacksmith (crafting)
  * Bakery (food)
  * King's vegetable farm (renewable food)

I will probably make some buildings that are purely for aesthetics:

  * City square
  * Graveyard
  * Tavern
  * Park
  * City hall
  * Fountain
  * Brothel

Some buildings aren't needed:

  * Guard barracks (the guard towers handle this)

Other possible ideas for the future are:

  * Streets
  * Splitting the city into districts
  * Street lanterns
