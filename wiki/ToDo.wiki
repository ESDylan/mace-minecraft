The focus for Mace 1.9 will be the content.

 * Theme generator (I'll do this when I'm happy with the structure of the theme files)
 * More buildings (City hall, Graveyard, etc)
 * Improve the existing buildings (less square!)
 * Add an option to generate empty plots for a multiplayer server (make this a theme?)
 * Optionally allow for specifying the city x/z co-ordinates
 * Add to FAQ: how to use with multiplayer servers
 * Move more constants to the city theme files
 * Link the noticeboard messages to the city buildings (maybe put in the buildings.xml file?)
 * Mineshaft features
  * Collapsed sections
  * Braces
  * Ladders up/down
  * Larger mineshaft sections
 * Maps
  * City / World
  * Wanted posters, bakery lists, book covers...
 * Add knights to the guard towers

== Maybe ==

These things might be too ambitious or just not possible.

 * Better transition between the city and the natural terrain
 * Docks district
 * Roads/rails
   * Buildings next to roads (farms, ruins, houses...)
   * Sign posts
