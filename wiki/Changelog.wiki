= 1.6.1 =

 * Portrait bug is fixed. Thank you to Ghostdancer for letting me know about that.
 * Fixed the rail rotation bug. Thank you to Commander Keen for letting me know about that.
 * Added lots more library sections and tavern combinations. All provided by SoNick - thanks!
 * Changed the way the lighting is called, which seems to have reduced the lighting bugs.
 * Cities without farms now have 8 empty blocks outside, rather than 16. Thank you to Arschkrampi for hassling me into that!
 * Made a couple of minor changes to the buildings.
 * Added a new compact house, submitted by coau14. Thanks!
 * Set the application support directory for Mac OSX, but I'm unable to test this, so it might not work.
 * If an obsidian wall is selected and "Valuable blocks in architecture" is unchecked, the first option will take preference. So consequently the obsidian wall will stay. Thanks to Keypadzzz for letting me know about this conflict.

= 1.6 - The Underground Update =

 * The code is now significantly more compatible with Linux and has been tested successfully in Mono on Ubuntu 11.04. Massive thank you to Surrogard for rewriting my code to make it friendly to Windows and Linux.
 * Added a mineshaft below the city. The entrance is in the middle of the city.
 * Underground terrain is now stone, dirt, gravel and sand (with occasional sandstone).
 * Ores are generated underground.
 * Added a new frequency type: "unique". Each unique building will appear a maximum of once per city. Unique buildings must be at least 10 squares away from another unique building.
 * Added a cathedral, archery range, prison, pyramid and large fountain. These all have the "unique" frequency.
 * Added a castle, which was designed by [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRealMegaMiner TheMegaMiner]. The castle has the "unique" frequency value.
 * Added a simple house made of stone and bricks.
 * Added a tent building.
 * Added an apartment building. Thanks to redjay17 for this suggestion.
 * A small number of barns will now appear sporadically between the farms.
 * The noticeboard is now a building, that will randomly appear somewhere in most cities. It has the "unique" frequency.
 * Made a whole bunch of small improvements to the existing buildings. Items in the bakery, more noticeboard messages, paintings, basements, changing room in the baths, longer diving board, lava instead of fire in the baths, random drink names in the tavern, random library sections...
 * City wall material is now selectable. It will default to a random type.
 * Guard towers now allow for flags, instead of fire beacons. You can let Mace randomly chose between the two, or pick one yourself.
 * Churches are now "very rare" frequency, rather than "rare".
 * Graveyards are now excluded, because the cathedral has a graveyard.
 * Added help to all of the controls in the application.
 * Added an option to make all chests empty.
 * Added an option to turn valuable blocks in architecture to less valuable blocks.
 * Mob spawners placed in the Mace resource world will now work. Thanks to Ghostdancer for letting me know they were broken.
 * I accidentally extinguished all the fires in a previous version, but they are now back to normal.
 * Added two new emblems: heart and cobweb

= 1.5.1 =

 * This version fixes a bug that prevented people from setting the world name. Thank you to shad3w44 for letting me know about that.

= 1.5 =

 * Added nine new buildings: market, house with a garden roof, shrine, baths, library, mosque, swimming pool and two ruined buildings
 * "Very rare" buildings will not spawn within 50 blocks of the same type of building. "Rare" buildings will not spawn within 25 blocks of the same type of building.
 * Greenhouses are now "rare" frequency, rather than "average". Thanks to Sammmiii for this suggestion.
 * Streets names are now all unique.
 * Mace will now automatically work out the height of imported buildings. The starting Y axis is set to 63 (ground level) by default, which can be overwritten by adding {{{<source_start_y>7</source_start_y>}}} (change 7 to be the lowest point of your building) to the relevent section of the buildings.xml file.
 * Building names on signs are now unique. Gravestones are unique within each graveyard.
 * Street signs now have torches on top of them.
 * The mini farms in the city will no longer have naughty pigs ruining them. Thanks to Sammmiii for letting me know about that.
 * House chests around the city now have random assorted items in them. Thanks to Ghostdancer for pointing out how empty they all were
 * Added a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page to the wiki
 * You can now specify the city/world name, as long as it doesn't already exist. Thanks to Ghostdancer for suggesting this.
 * Buildings are rotated to the nearest path
 * City names will no longer be the same word twice (i.e. Carnivalcarnival)
 * Street lights have moved to the side of the roads
 * Random sign types are no longer hard-coded. Thanks to Curufea for suggesting this
 * The project is now compatible with Mono 2.6 Beta 3, so in theory (I can't test this) it should be possible to load the project in that on a Mac or Linux and run it
 * Coffins are now chests, full of bones and other items. Thanks to infraspace for this suggestion
 * Added/modified/removed some of the random sign text
 * Changed the size properties of the Mace window, so hopefully it won't go all massive on some computers.
 * You can now specify a random seed for the !MineCraft world and a random seed for the city generation. The seeds are displayed on the noticeboard. Please note, changing any options in Mace will usually affect the random number generator for the city, so if you share your seed with anyone else, remember to tell them which options you used. Also note that seeds are version specific, so using a seed in V1.5 will result in a different city to using it in V1.6.
 * A very small amount of the larger ponds will now be lava, rather than water. Thanks to Lokomo for this suggestion
 * Added a Credits page to the wiki
 * City emblem data is now stored in text files in the resources folder. You can add/remove/edit them as much as you like.
 * Portraits are imported from the source world. Thanks to jaquadro for helping me with the code for this
 * Download size is massively reduced, from 1955kb to 263kb
 * Added glass blocks to the fountain, which will hopefully stop wolves getting stuck in there. Thanks to shad3w44 for letting me know about this bug.

= 1.4 =

 * Rewrote the path layout code, to divide the city into rectangles
 * Random buildings are imported into the city. They are chosen by weighted randomness (so more houses and trees, rather than statues and graveyards)
 * Buildings are stored in the Mace world (in the Resources folder), which can be edited in !MineCraft
 * Building data is stored in buildings.xml, which means it is possible to add and remove buildings, or change how frequently they appear
 * Made about twenty buildings
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and the east/west entrance. They are slightly wider and have street lights
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
 * Wheat farms are now covered in glass, to stop spiders destroying them. Thanks to Curufea for letting me know about that.

 * Beacons are now optional
 * Wrote name generators for the taverns, brothels, gravestones, bakery, library, statue and churches
 * Added two city emblems
 * Added mushroom farms
 * Added street names
 * City size now aligns with chunk size, to make the edges a little better

= 1.3 =

  * Added three city emblems (by default Mace will choose a random one, but you can specify if you prefer, or just not have one)
  * Added cactus moats
  * Added a new room to the bottom half of the guard towers, with beds and doors to the city.
  * Added several million squiggly brackets to the code
  * Water moat is now one block higher, so the player and mobs can get out easily
  * Crenels now have a new design. Thanks to Golgrinn for the design and suggestion
  * Fixed the city saplings being unstackable with regular saplings. Thanks to Golgrinn for the bug report

  * Thanks to Curufea for these suggestions:
    * Fences now appear about 50% of the time on sugarcane farms
    * Some farms will now have hedges instead of fences
    * Maximum size of a farm has been increased from 14 to 24 blocks
    * New moat option: drop to bedrock

= 1.2 =

  * The interface is done. It allows for switching off sections (moat, guard towers, farms, etc) along with setting the moat liquid and city size.
  * Thanks to Curufea for this suggestion:
    * City name data is now stored in two text files: CityStartingWords.txt and CityEndingWords.txt. The city name is made by combining a random word from the first file with a random word from the second file. Feel free to add more words or suggest words to me and I'll add them to the official version.
