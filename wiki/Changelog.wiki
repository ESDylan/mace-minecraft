= 1.8 - The Trinity Transition =

*Major updates:*
 * Multiple cities! Mace now generates multiple cities in the same world. You can specify the amount of cities that you would like.
 * City themes! The theme determines the buildings and the possible emblems, moats, flowers, paths, city names, tower additions, farms and more. Mace currently has three themes:
   * Medieval buildings - Most of the buildings from the previous version
   * Novv's medieval buildings - Used with permission. Thanks Novv!
   * Desert buildings - Just a small number at the moment.
 * New interface! The new interface is focussed on customising the world.

*Miner updates:*
 * Added five new emblems created by Ghostdancer. They are emblems of a creeper, a pickaxe, a sword, a tree and the crafters' guild.
 * Added a sandstone creeper mine entrance by Ghostdancer.
 * Generated worlds will now appear at the top of your Minecraft world list.
 * There's now two cactus moats - one at normal level and the original submerged one.
 * Added the progress percentage to the window title.
 * Lowered the fire and lava moats, to stop them setting fire to emblems.
 * You can decide to spawn inside/outside a random city, or away from the generated cities.
 * Cities without farms will now have flowers on the empty area outside.
 * The doors on farms are now fence gates.
 * The world type can be creative, survival or hardcore.
 * The cactus moat is a bit more random.
 * You can now view the normal log (same as before) or the verbose log (includes lots of details).
 * Redstone ore on the ground (layer 63) of the resource world will be turned into the city ground block.
 * Gold ore on the ground (layer 63) of the resource world will be turned into the path block.

= 1.7.2 =

 * This release fixes the lighting bug with chests. Thanks to jaquadro for providing the fix.

= 1.7.1 =

 * The bank now goes down to it's intended level. Thank you to shad3w44 for letting me know about that.
 * The position of the large sandstone house is now correct. Thank you to Curufea for letting me know about that.

= 1.7 - The Improvement Iteration =

NPCs

 * You can now tell Mace to include NPC spawners in the city, which will use Ghostdancer's Mobs for Mace. Please see the Mobs for Mace thread for download instructions.

Buildings

 * Added a windmill to the farming buildings (unique frequency).
 * Added a bank, which is inspired by coau14's bank (unique frequency).
 * Added a theatre (average frequency).
 * Added an igloo, which was created by coau14 (unique frequency).
 * Added a wool house with a hedge-garden (average frequency).
 * Added a blacksmith, tailor and water well (all rare frequency).
 * Added two sandstone houses (common frequency).
 * Added a wizard's tower (unique frequency).
 * Added a large park (unique frequency).

Mineshaft

 * Written in mineshaft features, which are things like lava pools, resting stations, dungeons...
 * The mineshaft now has a proper entrance that will appear in a random location in the city.
 * Added four mineshaft entrance designs, all created by Ghostdancer. Mace will select one entrance to use in the city.
 * The balloon will appear above the mineshaft entrance, which helps to locate it. Thanks to Ghostdancer for this suggestion.
 * Slightly changed the location of resources: gold + diamonds are in the lowest third, lapis + redstone are in the lowest two thirds and coal + iron are found everywhere.
 * In mineshaft chests the common blocks will now appear in larger amounts.
 * Mineshafts will no longer have gravel ceilings on the highest four levels and they will no longer have sand ceilings on the highest two levels. This stops the ceiling collapsing on you in the higher levels. Thank you to !BrianSki for this idea.

Code / Config

 * The code has been successfully tested in Mono 2.6 RC1 on Windows. If you run it in that version on a mac, please let me know what happens - good or bad! Including error messages is very useful to me.
 * Made a lot of minor changes to the code to bring it more inline with C# standards. It's still got a long way to go though.
 * Updated to Substrate 0.7.
 * Sponge in the resource world is turned into a random wool colour for each building. This is useful for randomly coloured carpets.
 * The list of farm buildings, mineshaft sections and mineshaft entrances are taken from buildings.xml, which means anyone can add new buildings of these types. These buildings can use all the frequency values.
 * The rail rotation code saves more frequently, which should hopefully fix any remaining issues. It is applied to the whole city now, so any rails placed in resource buildings will be turned appropriately. It doesn't look at different elevations yet.

Bugs

 * Outside fire lights will no longer set fire to the flags.

Moat

 * Added a fire moat, which will appear 10% of the time. Thanks to coau14 for this suggestion.

Minor Stuff

 * City walls now go down to bedrock. Thanks to Commander Keen for this suggestion.
 * Added an option to export the city as a schematic.
 * Apartment frequency has been switched to "very rare" instead of "average".
 * Flowers and grass will appear in more places in the city.
 * The mini farms are now enclosed to stop animals destroying them.
 * Added some more combinations to the brothel names.
 * Street signs are now on posts. Thanks to shad3w44 for this suggestion.
 * House chests now have a slightly larger variety of items.
 * Improved the house signs.
 * Mace will now randomly choose between the usual glowstone street lights and the new torch street lights. Thanks to !BrianSki for this idea.
 * Very small cities had an unrealistically large number of unique buildings, so I've disabled prioritising unique buildings on very small cities.
 * Added some more wall materials.
 * Buildings have little paths, which link to the roads when possible.

= 1.6.1 =

 * Portrait bug is fixed. Thank you to Ghostdancer for letting me know about that.
 * Fixed the rail rotation bug. Thank you to Commander Keen for letting me know about that.
 * Added lots more library sections and tavern combinations. All provided by !SoNick - thanks!
 * Changed the way the lighting is called, which seems to have reduced the lighting bugs.
 * Cities without farms now have 8 empty blocks outside, rather than 16. Thank you to Arschkrampi for hassling me into that!
 * Made a couple of minor changes to the buildings.
 * Added a new compact house, submitted by coau14. Thanks!
 * Set the application support directory for Mac OSX, but I'm unable to test this, so it might not work.
 * If an obsidian wall is selected and "Valuable blocks in architecture" is unchecked, the first option will take preference. So consequently the obsidian wall will stay. Thanks to Keypadzzz for letting me know about this conflict.

= 1.6 - The Underground Update =

 * The code is now significantly more compatible with Linux and has been tested successfully in Mono on Ubuntu 11.04. Massive thank you to Surrogard for rewriting my code to make it friendly to Windows and Linux.
 * Added a mineshaft below the city. The entrance is in the middle of the city.
 * Underground terrain is now stone, dirt, gravel and sand (with occasional sandstone).
 * Ores are generated underground.
 * Added a new frequency type: "unique". Each unique building will appear a maximum of once per city. Unique buildings must be at least 10 squares away from another unique building.
 * Added a cathedral, archery range, prison, pyramid and large fountain. These all have the "unique" frequency.
 * Added a castle, which was designed by [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRealMegaMiner TheMegaMiner]. The castle has the "unique" frequency value.
 * Added a simple house made of stone and bricks.
 * Added a tent building.
 * Added an apartment building. Thanks to redjay17 for this suggestion.
 * A small number of barns will now appear sporadically between the farms.
 * The noticeboard is now a building, that will randomly appear somewhere in most cities. It has the "unique" frequency.
 * Made a whole bunch of small improvements to the existing buildings. Items in the bakery, more noticeboard messages, paintings, basements, changing room in the baths, longer diving board, lava instead of fire in the baths, random drink names in the tavern, random library sections...
 * City wall material is now selectable. It will default to a random type.
 * Guard towers now allow for flags, instead of fire beacons. You can let Mace randomly chose between the two, or pick one yourself.
 * Churches are now "very rare" frequency, rather than "rare".

 * Added help to all of the controls in the application.
 * Added an option to make all chests empty.

 * I accidentally extinguished all the fires in a previous version, but they are now back to normal.
 * Added two new emblems: heart and cobweb

= 1.5.1 =

 * This version fixes a bug that prevented people from setting the world name. Thank you to shad3w44 for letting me know about that.

= 1.5 =

 * Added nine new buildings: market, house with a garden roof, shrine, baths, library, mosque, swimming pool and two ruined buildings
 * "Very rare" buildings will not spawn within 50 blocks of the same type of building. "Rare" buildings will not spawn within 25 blocks of the same type of building.
 * Greenhouses are now "rare" frequency, rather than "average". Thanks to Sammmiii for this suggestion.
 * Streets names are now all unique.
 * Mace will now automatically work out the height of imported buildings. The starting Y axis is set to 63 (ground level) by default, which can be overwritten by adding {{{<source_start_y>7</source_start_y>}}} (change 7 to be the lowest point of your building) to the relevent section of the buildings.xml file.
 * Building names on signs are now unique. Gravestones are unique within each graveyard.
 * Street signs now have torches on top of them.
 * The mini farms in the city will no longer have naughty pigs ruining them. Thanks to Sammmiii for letting me know about that.
 * House chests around the city now have random assorted items in them. Thanks to Ghostdancer for pointing out how empty they all were
 * Added a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page to the wiki
 * You can now specify the city/world name, as long as it doesn't already exist. Thanks to Ghostdancer for suggesting this.
 * Buildings are rotated to the nearest path
 * City names will no longer be the same word twice (i.e. Carnivalcarnival)
 * Street lights have moved to the side of the roads
 * Random sign types are no longer hard-coded. Thanks to Curufea for suggesting this
 * The project is now compatible with Mono 2.6 Beta 3, so in theory (I can't test this) it should be possible to load the project in that on a Mac or Linux and run it
 * Coffins are now chests, full of bones and other items. Thanks to infraspace for this suggestion
 * Added/modified/removed some of the random sign text
 * Changed the size properties of the Mace window, so hopefully it won't go all massive on some computers.
 * You can now specify a random seed for the !MineCraft world and a random seed for the city generation. The seeds are displayed on the noticeboard. Please note, changing any options in Mace will usually affect the random number generator for the city, so if you share your seed with anyone else, remember to tell them which options you used. Also note that seeds are version specific, so using a seed in V1.5 will result in a different city to using it in V1.6.
 * A very small amount of the larger ponds will now be lava, rather than water. Thanks to Lokomo for this suggestion
 * Added a Credits page to the wiki
 * City emblem data is now stored in text files in the resources folder. You can add/remove/edit them as much as you like.
 * Portraits are imported from the source world. Thanks to jaquadro for helping me with the code for this
 * Download size is massively reduced, from 1955kb to 263kb

 * Building data is stored in buildings.xml, which means it is possible to add and remove buildings, or change how frequently they appear
 * Made about twenty buildings
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and the east/west entrance. They are slightly wider and have street lights
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
 * Wheat farms are now covered in glass, to stop spiders destroying them. Thanks to Curufea for letting me know about that.

 * Added two city emblems
 * Added mushroom farms
 * Added street names
 * City size now aligns with chunk size, to make the edges a little better

= 1.3 =

  * Water moat is now one block higher, so the player and mobs can get out easily
  * Crenels now have a new design. Thanks to Golgrinn for the design and suggestion
  * Fixed the city saplings being unstackable with regular saplings. Thanks to Golgrinn for the bug report

= 1.2 =

  * The interface is done. It allows for switching off sections (moat, guard towers, farms, etc) along with setting the moat liquid and city size.
  * Thanks to Curufea for this suggestion:
    * City name data is now stored in two text files: !CityStartingWords.txt and !CityEndingWords.txt. The city name is made by combining a random word from the first file with a random word from the second file. Feel free to add more words or suggest words to me and I'll add them to the official version.
