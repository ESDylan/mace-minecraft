#summary I use this page to keep track of changes in between versions

I am aiming to have these things in V1.5.0:

 * Rotating buildings to the nearest path.
 * Unique signs by city/instance.
 * More buildings (rich house with pool, ruined house)
 * Other stuff...

These changes are done and will be in V1.5.0:

 * Added a new building: market
 * Each "very rare" building will now appear a maximum of once per quarter of the city. Each "rare" building will now appear a maximum of twice per quarter of the city.
 * Greenhouses are now "rare" frequency, rather than "average". Thanks to Sammmiii for this suggestion.
 * Streets names are now all unique.
 * Mace will now automatically work out the height of imported buildings. The starting Y axis is set to 63 (ground level) by default, which can be overwriten by adding <source_start_y>7</source_start_y> (change 7 to be the lowest point of your building) to the relevent section of the buildings.xml file.
