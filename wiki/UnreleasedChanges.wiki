#summary I use this page to keep track of changes in between versions

The main focus of V1.4.0 will be the city buildings and their layout. Changes done so far:

 * The city is now randomly divided into rectangles by paths
 * Random buildings are imported into the city
 * Made a few simple buildings: several houses, crafting hut, graveyard, warehouse, statue, tavern, fountain, trees, greenhouse, bakery
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and then east/west entrance
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
