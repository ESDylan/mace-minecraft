#summary I use this page to keep track of changes in between versions

The main focus of V1.4.0 will be the city buildings and their layout. Changes done so far:

 * The city is now randomly divided into rectangles by paths
 * Random buildings are imported into the city. They are chosen by weighted randomness (so more houses and trees, rather than statues and graveyards)
 * Buildings are stored in the Mace world (in the Resources folder), which can be edited in !MineCraft
 * Building data is stored in buildings.xml, which means it is possible to add and remove buildings
 * Made about twenty buildings
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and the east/west entrance. They are slightly wider and have street lights
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
 * Wheat farms are now covered in glass, to stop spiders destroying them. Thanks to Curufea for letting me know about that.
 * City size now aligns with chunk size, to make the edges a little better
 * Flowers and grass will now randomly appear amongst the farms and in the city
 * Outside light sources will now be fires or torches. This can be specified before generating
 * Beacons are now optional
 * Wrote name generators for the taverns, brothels and churches
 * Added two city emblems
 * Added mushroom farms
