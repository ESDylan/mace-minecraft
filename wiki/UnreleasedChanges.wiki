Done

 * Output worlds are in Anvil format.
 * The resource world has been converted to Anvil format.
 * Fixed a bug in the city entrance validation code for custom themes. Thank you to empyreanunseen for letting me know about this.
 * Fixed a bug with various plant types in custom themes. Thank you to coau14 for letting me know about this.
 * Desert cities are set to be in the desert biome. This means they will no longer get rain or snow.
 * Items in brewing stands and dispensers in the resource world are now copied to the output world. Items in furnaces were already being copied over.
 * Inverted stairs in the resource world are correctly handled when imported. Inverted half-slabs were already working.
 * Updated the door data to Anvil format. This means doors will be rotated correctly again.
 * Added a trap to the mineshaft.
 * Custom themes can now have empty plots. These are useful if you want to start building straight away.
 * Added two more city entrances.
 * Reduced the value of treasure found in houses.

Planned
