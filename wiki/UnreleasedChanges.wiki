The next version will just be a small update to fix bugs.

== Done ==

 * Portrait bug is fixed. Thank you to Ghostdancer for letting me know about that.
 * Fixed the rail rotation bug. Thank you to Commander Keen for letting me know about that.
 * Added lots more library sections and tavern combinations. All provided by !SoNick - thanks!
 * Cities without farms now have 8 empty blocks outside, rather than 16. Thank you to Arschkrampi for hassling me into that!
 * Made a couple of minor changes to the buildings.
 * Added coau14's house
 * Set the application support directory for Mac OSX, but I'm unable to test this and unsure if I've done it correctly.
 * If an obsidian wall is selected and "Valuable blocks in architecture" is unchecked, the first option will take preference. So consequently the obsidian wall will stay.
