 * Fixed a bug in the city entrance validation code for custom themes. Thank you to empyreanunseen for letting me know about this.
 * Fixed a bug with various plant types in custom themes. Thank you to coau14 for letting me know about this.
 * Fixed a bug when using the desert adjectives/nouns in custom themes. Thank you to Mitchell_R for letting me know about this.
 * Fixed animals not spawning in the barn. Thank you to coau14 for letting me know about this.
 * Output worlds are in Anvil format.
 * The resource world has been converted to Anvil format.
 * Desert cities are set to be in the desert biome. This means they will no longer get rain or snow.
 * Items in brewing stands and dispensers in the resource world are now copied to the output world. Items in furnaces were already being copied over.
 * Inverted stairs in the resource world are correctly handled when imported. Inverted half-slabs were already working.
 * Updated the door data to Anvil format. This means doors will be rotated correctly again.
 * Added a trap to the mineshaft.
 * Custom themes can now have empty plots. These are useful if you want to start building straight away.
 * Added two more city entrances.
 * Reduced the value of treasure found in houses.
 * The main streets can now be turned off in the theme generator. Themes generated in v1.10 will assume that main streets are wanted.
 * The type of wood planks and logs are randomised for each building.
 * Removed the !SplitContainer control, so hopefully it will work on Linux and OSX again. Please let me know either way.
 * Fixed the progress bar going above 100%.
 * Added guards to the top of the walls. If Minecraft Villagers are selected, this will be iron golems. If Ghostdancer's NPCs are selected, this will be knights.
