#summary I use this page to keep track of changes in between versions

The main focus of V1.4.0 will be the city buildings and their layout. Changes done so far:

 * The city is now randomly divided into rectangles by paths
 * Random buildings are imported into the city. They are chosen by weighted randomness (so more houses and trees, rather than statues and graveyards)
 * Buildings are stored in the Mace world (in the Resources folder), which can be edited in !MineCraft. Building data is stored in buildings.xml, which means it is possible to add and remove buildings.
 * Made about fifteen buildings
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and the east/west entrance
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
 * City size now aligns with chunk size, to make the edges a little better
 * Flowers and grass will now randomly appear amongst the farms and in the city
 * Outside light sources will now be fires or torches. This can be specified before generating
