These changes are done and will be in Mace 1.9:

*Farms*

 * Farms are now on one side of the city.
 * Removed the code-generated farms.
 * Added farm buildings: melon farms, pumpkin farms, wheat farms (large & small), cactus farms (large & small), orchards (oak, birch, spruce), sugar cane farms, animal farms.
 * Improved the top of the mushroom farms.
 * Farms now have torches.

*Other*

 * New buildings: Large ruins (medieval theme), Shop (desert theme), three houses (desert theme), compound (desert theme).
 * Lots of the new blocks are being used: window panes, stone bricks, iron bars, melons, pumpkins, slabs...
 * Small improvements to a few existing buildings.
 * Added an option to export schematics of each city.
 * Added buttons to save the logs to a file. The logs are saved in the world directory. I don't want to make it more complicated than that, because it would make compatibility with Linux/OSX harder.

*Code*

 * Updated to Substrate 1.0.1.
 * Added rotation code for: brick stairs, nether brick stairs, stone brick stairs, fence gates, burning furnaces, open trapdoors, redstone repeaters, levers, pistons, detector rails, powered rails, vines, huge mushrooms.
 * Flag patterns are now stored in files in the resource folder.

.

This is a list of items that I would like to include in 1.9:

 * Torches on the city walls will heat up ice blocks - need to fix this
 * More desert buildings
 * Move more constants to the city theme files
