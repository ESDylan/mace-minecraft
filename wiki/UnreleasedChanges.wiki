The next version will be V1.7 - The Improvement Iteration.

== Done ==

 * Added a windmill to the farming buildings. It has the unique frequency.
 * Added a theatre. It has the unique frequency.
 * Added an igloo, which was created by coau14. It has the unique frequency.
 * Slightly changed the location of resources: gold + diamonds are in the lowest third, lapis + redstone are in the lowest two thirds and coal + iron are found everywhere.
 * Apartment frequency is now "rare" rather than "average".
 * Outside fire lights will no longer set fire to the flags.
 * Flowers and grass will now spawn in more places in the city.
 * The mini farm is now enclosed to stop animals destroying it.
 * Added some more combinations to the brothel names.
 * Improved the house signs.
 * Added some more wall materials.
 * Sponge in the resource world is turned into a random wool colour for each building. This is useful for randomly coloured carpets.
 * The list of farm buildings is no longer hard-coded into Mace. It is taken from buildings.xml and uses all the frequency values. Farm buildings have a "farm" property. This means anyone can add new farm buildings.
