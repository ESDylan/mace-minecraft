This page lists the features that are expected in v1.8:

== Done ==

 * Buildings are now divided into three themes. They are Medieval (most of the existing buildings), Desert (the existing sandstone buildings) and Novv's Medieval buildings (new to Mace!).
 * Different city name files for each theme
 * Specified block types allow for a data value
 * There's now two cactus moats - one at normal level and the original submerged one
 * Added five new emblems, created by Ghostdancer. They are emblems of a creeper, a pickaxe, a sword, the crafters' guild and a tree.
 * Lowered the fire and lava moats, to stop them setting fire to emblems
 * Each city theme can have a different ground block (e.g. sand in the desert city)
 * Redstone ore on the ground (layer 63) of the resource world will be turned into the city ground block.
 * Path block can now be specified for each city theme.
 * Gold ore on the ground (layer 63) of the resource world will be turned into the path block.
 * Flowers can be specified for each city theme (e.g. cacti and dead shrubs in the desert city)
 * Cities without farms will now have flowers on the empty area outside
 * The doors on farms are now fence gates

== In Progress ==

 * Multiple cities
 * New interface

== Planned ==

 * Ghostdancer's new mineshaft entrance
 * Allowed farm types should be specified in the city themes
 * Allow for creative or survival worlds
 * Spawn point code
 * Make the cactus moats a bit more random
 * Fire-proof combinations
 * Fix flower spawning

== Maybe ==

 * Roads (need to figure out a way for roads to not look awful)
