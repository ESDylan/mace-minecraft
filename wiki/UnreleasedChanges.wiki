These are the changes for version 1.7 - The Improvement Iteration.

== Done ==

 * Added a windmill to the farming buildings. It has the unique frequency.
 * Added a theatre. It has the unique frequency.
 * Added an igloo, which was created by coau14. It has the unique frequency.
 * Added a blacksmith. It has rare frequency.
 * Added a water well. It has rare frequency.
 * Added two sandstone houses. They both have common frequency.
 * The mineshaft now has a proper entrance that will appear in a random location in the city.
 * Added four mineshaft entrances designs, all created by Ghostdancer. Mace will select one entrance to use in the city.
 * Slightly changed the location of resources: gold + diamonds are in the lowest third, lapis + redstone are in the lowest two thirds and coal + iron are found everywhere.
 * Apartment frequency is now "rare" rather than "average".
 * Outside fire lights will no longer set fire to the flags.
 * Flowers and grass will now spawn in more places in the city.
 * The mini farm is now enclosed to stop animals destroying it.
 * Added some more combinations to the brothel names.
 * Street signs are now on posts. Thanks to shad3w44 for this suggestion.
 * Improved the house signs.
 * Very small cities had an unrealistically large number of unique buildings, so I've disabled prioritising unique buildings on very small cities.
 * Added some more wall materials.
 * Sponge in the resource world is turned into a random wool colour for each building. This is useful for randomly coloured carpets.
 * The list of farm buildings and mineshaft entrances are taken from buildings.xml, which means anyone can add new buildings of these types. These buildings can use all the frequency values.

== In Progress ==

 * Spawners for _Mobs for Mace_ by Ghostdancer.
 * Exclude the mineshaft entrance when there's no mineshaft.

== Planned ==

 * Update to Substrate 0.7.
 * Option to export city as schematic.
 * Mineshaft features.
 * See the [ToDo] list.
