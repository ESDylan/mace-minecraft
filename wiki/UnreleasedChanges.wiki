I am aiming to have these things in V1.5.0:

 * Importing portraits (if I can figure out how to do that)
 * More buildings (normal library, ruined house)
 * Other stuff...

These changes are done and will be in V1.5.0:

 * Added new buildings: market, house with a garden roof, shrine, baths
 * "Very rare" buildings will not spawn within 50 blocks of the same type of building. "Rare" buildings will not spawn within 25 blocks of the same type of building.
 * Greenhouses are now "rare" frequency, rather than "average". Thanks to Sammmiii for this suggestion.
 * Streets names are now all unique.
 * Mace will now automatically work out the height of imported buildings. The starting Y axis is set to 63 (ground level) by default, which can be overwritten by adding {{{<source_start_y>7</source_start_y>}}} (change 7 to be the lowest point of your building) to the relevent section of the buildings.xml file.
 * Building names on signs are now unique. Gravestones are unique within each graveyard.
 * Street signs now have torches on top of them.
 * The mini farms in the city will no longer have naughty pigs ruining them. Thanks to Sammmiii for letting me know about that.
 * House chests around the city now have random assorted items in them. Thanks to Ghostdancer for pointing out how empty they all were
 * Added a [FAQ] (Frequently Asked Questions) page to the wiki
 * You can now specify the city/world name, as long as it doesn't already exist. Thanks to Ghostdancer for suggesting this.
 * Buildings are rotated to the nearest path
 * City names will no longer be the same word twice (i.e. Carnivalcarnival)
 * Street lights have moved to the side of the roads
 * Random sign types are no longer hard-coded. Thanks to Curufea for suggesting this
 * The project is now compatible with Mono 2.6 Beta 3, so in theory (I can't test this) it should be possible to load the project in that on a Mac or Linux and run it
 * Coffins are now chests, full of bones and other items. Thanks to infraspace for this suggestion
