I am currently writing v1.10. The main focus of this update will be the Theme Generator.

=== To Do ===

  * Need some way to control the amount of valuable resources.

=== In Progress ===

  * Make sure I'm happy with the XML file structure/identifiers.
  * Write a theme generator.
     * Interface: 100% done
     * Validating user selections: 100% done
     * Writing theme file: 100% done
     * Testing: 0% done

=== Done ===
  * Add a fence around the bedrock moat.
  * Put a real mushroom on top of the mushroom farm. Thanks to coau14 for this suggestion.
  * Updated screenshots of Mace.
  * Moved buildings to more logical places in the resource world.
  * Added some more combinations to the desert city names.
  * Added some more combinations to the world names.
  * You can now control which levels of the mineshaft will appear. Edit the end of the mineshaft.xml file to do this.
