#summary I use this page to keep track of changes in between versions

The main focus of V1.4.0 will be the city buildings and their layout. Changes done so far:

 * The city is now randomly divided into rectangles by paths
 * Random buildings are imported into the city. They are chosen by weighted randomness (so more houses and trees, rather than statues and graveyards)
 * Made a few simple buildings: several houses, crafting hut, graveyard, warehouse, statue, tavern, fountain, trees, greenhouse, bakery
 * Added main roads going through the city, which link the north/south entrance and the east/west entrance
 * Removed the sewer. I want to focus development time on the city
 * City size now aligns with chunk size, to make the edges a little better
 * Flowers and grass will now randomly appear amongst the farms
 * Outside light sources will now be fires or torches. This can be specified before generating
