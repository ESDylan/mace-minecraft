The aim for v1.8 is to have multiple cities and city themes. These two features are going to take a long time to write.

There's also some things I'd like to do before v1.8:

 * Add links to non-English videos about Mace to the Mace thread
 * Provide details about submitting buildings

The current plan is to include the new !MineCraft features (from the Adventure Update) in Mace v1.9.
